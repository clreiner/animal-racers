animal-racers
=============

Racing game for Code Fellows Foundations I class. This is a modification of a racing game that Brook wrote in class. I expanded the available racers to include a cat and a pig. I also allowed the user to choose an animal and name it and to decide which type of animal to race against. I referenced stackoverflow.com for several random questions and phrogz.net for prototype inheritance questions.
